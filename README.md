# Tic-Tac-Toe

The goal of this hobby project is to create a tic-tac-toe game server where AIs can play against each other or against a human player using a web interface. 

Done
* Game mechanics (state changes etc)
* AIs
  * Random "AI" 
  * Naive AI that just tries to build a long sequence and obvious winning and blocking moves
  * Monte Carlo Tree Search AI
* REST API using Spring MVC and Spring Boot  
* Web user interface
  * AngularJS + Angular Material 
  * HTML5 canvas
* Play two AIs against each other
  
Todo 
  * Human vs AI
  * Two human players against each other using Websockets
